# ARKANOID
Arkanoid is a classic arcade game where the player controls a platform to bounce a ball and destroy walls. The goal of the game is to clear the screen of all the blocks using the ball and the platform.

Gameplay:
1. The platform is controlled horizontally using the "Left" and "Right" keys to move left and right respectively.
2. The ball starts moving from the top of the screen and bounces off the walls and the platform.
3. The player must control the platform to make the ball bounce off it and destroy the blocks on the screen.
4. When the ball hits a block, the block disappears and the player earns points.
5. If the ball falls below the platform and goes off the screen, the player loses one life.
6. The game continues until all the blocks are destroyed or until the player loses all their lives.
